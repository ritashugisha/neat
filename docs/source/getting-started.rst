End Users
---------
Typically end users should have to only configure the config file required by a client whose superclass is :class:`neat.client.AbstractClient`.
For example, NEAT comes with a :class:`neat.client.BasicClient` which uses `YAML <http://yaml.org>`_ to indicate what is required for the engine.
