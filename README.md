# NEAT
_Appstate's networked energy appliance translator (NEAT)._

[Appalachian State University](http://www.appstate.edu/) as of 2016 is considered by [aashe](http://www.aashe.org/) to have the best sustainable campus out of their selection pool.[^1]
In order to achieve this, Appstate has had to mount renewable energy appliances (along with sensors) across their campus in order to ensure their devices are functioning optimally.
Along with this, several machines have been set up to continually pipe the sensory information provided by these devices to a simple file server.
Because these devices come from different vendors and from various time periods, it becomes increasingly difficult to store the **actually useful** sensory information provided by these devices as more and more of them are added to the network.

> The goal of the NEAT system, is to take sensory input from the already present pipes and then perform translation, simplification, and optimal storage of the data into a real-time database.

We hope to provide a modular enough architecture to be built upon horizontally in a fashion which is easy for novice and experienced developers to "get their hands dirty" using the system as soon as possible.
Removing as much complexity as possible from the developer trying to retrieve useful data, greatly eases the ability for future visualization and analysis.
